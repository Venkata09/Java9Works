With the advancement of Information Technology and Computing there rose the need for systems that react to situations. Consequently, it was necessary not to limit Java only to Object-Oriented Programming Paradigm. Many front-end technologies embraced reactive paradigm. Third party libraries like RxJs, RxJava, etc came into existence because of the demand for incorporation of this paradigm. Although Java 9 comes with an implementation for Reactive Streams, what it provides is still minimal. But the Java developer community hopes to get enhancements for the API in the near future.
